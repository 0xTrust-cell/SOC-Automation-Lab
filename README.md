# SOC-Automation-Lab
This project is a fully virtualized Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab designed for hands-on Threat Detection and Incident Response (TDIR) practice. It simulates a small enterprise environment with centralized monitoring via Wazuh, a pfSense firewall with Snort IDS/IPS, and multiple endpoints. Includes SOAR implementation (Shuffle).
