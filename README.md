# SOC Automation Lab (Homelab)
This project is a fully virtualized Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab designed for hands-on experience planning, designing, and creating a SOC automated environment. It simulates a small corporate environment with centralized monitoring via Wazuh SIEM, a pfSense firewall with Snort IDS/IPS, and multiple endpoints. Lab also includes SOAR implementation (Shuffle).

## üìå Overview
The lab runs entirely in **VMware Workstation** on a single host machine, using an **isolated host-only network** with pfSense acting as the gateway and WAN interface for simulated internet access.

**Core Features:**
- **Wazuh Manager + Indexer + Dashboard** for SIEM capabilities
- **pfSense Firewall** with Snort IDS/IPS for traffic monitoring and blocking
- **Windows 10 Endpoint** with Sysmon and Wazuh agent for log forwarding
- **Ubuntu Desktop** Wazuh agent for analyst workstation
- **Shuffle** for automation and orchestration
- **TheHive** for incident response case manangement
- **Simulated WAN** for realistic traffic flow
